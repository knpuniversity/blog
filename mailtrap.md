# Mailtrap Tutorial = (Free) Mailer + Webhook + Contributing back to Symfony  

Good news Symfony peeps: we now have an updated Mailer tutorial that also covers the Webhook component *and* is free thanks to Mailtrap.

We use Mailtrap (which is amazing btw) to get a total refresher on using Mailer: itâ€™s like the original tutorial, but updated and with extra goodies.

## Why Mailtrap?  

Testing emails **shouldn't suck**. Real SMTP servers? Clunky. Sending test emails? Messy. Spamming real users? Disaster.  

Mailtrap gives you a **sandboxed email testing environment** â€” send, preview, inspect, and even check spam scores in one place.  

## Mailer & Webhook Superpowers  

Weâ€™re going deep on Symfonyâ€™s **Mailer**: queueing, Twig templates, and more. But this time we go further: **Webhooks.**  

Webhooks let us react in real-time when emails are delivered, opened, or bounced, which is important because if you keep trying to send emails to a bouncing address, it hurts your domainâ€™s SPAM reputation. Boo!

## Contributing Back to Symfony  

While integrating Mailtrap, we hit a few limitations in Symfonyâ€™s **Webhook component**â€”so we **fixed them**! In fact there were several improvements:

- Mailtrap Bridge PR: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/58252
- Mailtrap Bridge Webhook PR: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/58403
- Bulk webhook event parsing PR: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/58248
- SendGrid's bridge to benefit from bulk: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/58401

Those improvements are now part of Symfony core.  

Big win for the community. Big win for you.
