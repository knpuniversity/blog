# Remembering Ryan Weaver

With deep sadness, we share that Ryan Weaver â€” co-founder of SymfonyCasts, father, husband, beloved teacher, and
friend â€” has passed away after a long and courageous journey with brain cancer.

Ryan was so much more than the face of SymfonyCasts. He was the heart, the voice, the spark of energy that made
learning fun. His humor, warmth, and love of teaching touched countless developers around the world.

## Ryan and SymfonyCasts

From the very beginning, SymfonyCasts (then KnpUniversity) was Ryanâ€™s dream: to make learning Symfony approachable,
joyful, and even a little silly.

He believed tutorials didnâ€™t need to be dry or intimidating. Instead, he brought coding to life with jokes, stories,
and a contagious enthusiasm that made you want to keep learning. That combination â€” deep expertise with playful
teaching â€” became the soul of SymfonyCasts.

If youâ€™ve ever laughed at a _dad joke_ in a tutorial, or suddenly had a lightbulb moment while watching a video,
that was Ryanâ€™s magic at work.

## A Teacher Who Made a Difference

Ryan never saw SymfonyCasts as just a business. It was his way of helping people. He poured himself into every
script, every recording session, every course â€” always asking, _How can I make this clearer?_ _How can I make this fun?_

Through SymfonyCasts, Ryan reached thousands of developers across the world. Many have shared that his teaching
changed their careers, gave them confidence, and opened new opportunities they never thought possible. That ripple
effect is Ryanâ€™s true legacy.

## Beyond the Videos

To those of us who worked with him, Ryan wasnâ€™t just a co-founder â€” he was a friend. He cared about people first.
He had a way of making everyone feel seen, of turning ordinary moments into something joyful, and of connecting
deeply with developers in the community.

Even in difficult times, he found joy in teaching and in lifting others up.

## Carrying His Legacy Forward

Though Ryan is no longer with us, SymfonyCasts will continue to carry forward the vision he started. Every new
course, every tutorial, every bit of joy in learning will be in his honor.

We invite you to share your memories of Ryan â€” whether itâ€™s a favorite SymfonyCasts moment, a video that made you
smile, or a story about how he inspired you.

Ryan, thank you for filling our community with laughter, knowledge, and heart. You changed so many lives, and
you will always be part of SymfonyCasts.

ðŸ’™ With love and gratitude,

Leanna, Kevin, Victor, Danielle & Diego
