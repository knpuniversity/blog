Accessing and Debugging Symfony Form Errors
===========================================

I recently saw an old post on StackOverflow called
`How to get form validation errors after binding the request to the form`_.
It has a lot of answers, most of them are only partially right and a lot
are outdated. So, I wanted to look at the *right* answer, and why it's that
way :).

.. tip::

    To see real examples of using forms and customizing form rendering, start
    off with our Symfony2 Series (`Episode 2`_ and `Episode 4`_ especially).

Debugging
---------

First, if you're trying to figure out what errors you have and which field
each is attached to, you should use the
:symfonymethod:`Form::getErrorsAsString() <Symfony\\Component\\Form\\Form::getErrorsAsString>`
method that was introduced in Symfony 2.1 (so a long time ago!). Use it temporarily
in a controller to see what's going on::

    public function formAction(Request $request)
    {
        $form = $this->createForm(new ProductType());

        $form->handleRequest($request);
        if ($form->isValid()) {
            // ... form handling
        }

        var_dump($form->getErrorsAsString());die;

        $this->render(
            'DemoBundle:Product:form.html.twig',
            array('form' => $form->createView())
        );
    }

That's it. To make things even simpler, you also have the `Form panel`_ of
the web debug toolbar in Symfony 2.4. So, debugging form errors 

Why $form->getErrors() doesn't Work
-----------------------------------

Raise your hand virtually if you've tried doing this to debug a form::

    public function formAction(Request $request)
    {
        $form = $this->createForm(new ProductType());
        
        $form->handleRequest($request);
        if ($form->isValid()) {
            // ... form handling
        }
        
        var_dump($form->getErrors());die;
        
        $this->render(
            'DemoBundle:Product:form.html.twig',
            array('form' => $form->createView())
        );
    }

What do you get? Almost definitely an empty array, even when the form has
lots of errors. Yea, I've been there too.

The reason is that a form is actually more than just one ``Form`` object:
it's a tree of ``Form`` objects. Each field is represented by its *own* ``Form``
object and the errors for that field are stored on it.

Assuming the form has ``name`` and ``price`` fields, how can we get the errors
for each field?

.. code-block:: php

    $globalErrors = $form->getErrors()
    $nameErrors = $form['name']->getErrors();
    $priceErrors = $form['price']->getErrors();

By saying ``$form['name']``, we get the ``Form`` object that represents *just*
the ``name`` field, which gives us access to *just* the errors attached to
that field. This means that there's no *one* spot to get *all* of the errors
on your entire form. Saying ``$form->getErrors()`` gives you only "global"
errors, i.e. errors that aren't attached to any specific field (e.g. a CSRF token
failure).

Render all the Errors at the Top of your Form
---------------------------------------------

One common question is how you might render all of your errors in one big
list at the top of your form. Again, there's no *one* spot where you can
get a big array of *all* of the errors, so you'd need to build it yourself::

    // a simple, but incomplete (see below) way to collect all errors
    $errors = array();
    foreach ($form as $fieldName => $formField) {
        // each field has an array of errors
        $errors[$fieldName] = $formField->getErrors();
    }

We can iterate over ``$form`` (a ``Form`` object) to get all of its fields.
And again, remember that each field (``$formField`` here), is also a ``Form``
object, which is why we can call
:symfonymethod:`Form::getErrors() <Symfony\\Component\\Form\\Form::getErrors>`
on each.

In reality, since a form can be many-levels deep, this solution isn't good
enough. Fortunately, someone already posted a more complete one on
`Stack Overflow`_ (see the 2.1 version).

From here, you can pass these into your template and render each. Of course,
you'll need to make sure that you don't call ``{{ form_errors() }}`` on any
of your fields, since you're printing the errors manually (and remember that
``form_row`` calls ``form_errors`` automatically).

.. note::

    Each field also has an `error_bubbling`_ option. If this is set to ``true``
    (it defaults to ``false`` for most fields), then the error will "bubble"
    and attach itself to the parent form. This means that if you set this
    option to ``true`` for *every* field, all errors would be attached to
    the top-level Form object and could be rendered by calling ``{{ form_errors(form) }}``
    in Twig.

Accessing Errors Inside Twig
----------------------------

We can also do some magic in Twig with errors using magical things called
*form variables*. These guys are *absolutely fundamental* to customizing
how your forms render.

.. note::

    If you're new to form theming and variables and need to master them,
    check out `Episode 4`_ of our Symfony series.

Normally, field errors are rendered in Twig by calling ``form_errors`` on
each individual field:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {{ form_errors(form) }}

    {{ form_label(form.name) }}
    {{ form_widget(form.name) }}
    {{ form_errors(form.name) }}

.. note::

    The ``form_row`` function calls ``form_errors`` internally.

Just like in the controller, the errors are attached to the individual fields
themselves. Hopefully it make sense now why ``form_errors(form)`` renders *global*
errors and ``form_errors(form.name)`` renders the errors attached to the
name field.

.. tip::

    Once you're in Twig, each field (e.g. ``form``, ``form.name``) is an instance
    of :symfonyclass:`Symfony\\Component\\Form\\FormView`.

If you need to customize how the errors are rendered, you can always use
`form theming`_. But you can also do it by leverage form variables:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {{ form_errors(form) }}
    
    {{ form_label(form.name) }}
    {{ form_widget(form.name) }}
    
    {% if form.name.vars.errors|length > 0 %}
    <ul class="form-errors name">
        {% for error in form.name.vars.errors %}
            {{ error }}
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}

The key here is ``form.name.vars``: a strange array of "variables" that you
have access to on *every* field. One of the variables you have access to
is ``errors``, but there are many others, like ``label`` and ``required``.
Each variable is normally used internally to render the field, but you can
use them manually if you need to:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    <label for="form.name.vars.id">
        {{ form.name.vars.label }} {{ form.name.vars.required ? '*' : '' }}
    </label>

To find out what variables a field has, just dump them:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {{ dump(form.price.vars) }}
    
It is also possible to compile a list of all form errors for the current form and display them inside a paragraph tah (or any other formatting you wish to use). This requires some additional looping:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {% set messages = [] %}
    {% for child in form.children %}
        {% if child.vars.errors|length > 0 %}
            {% for error in child.vars.errors %}
                {% set messages = messages|merge([error.message]) %}
            {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% if messages|length > 0 %}
        <p>
            {% for message in messages %}
                {{ message }}<br />
            {% endfor %}
        </p>
    {% endif %}


.. tip::

    When you are form theming, these variables become accessible in your
    form theme template as local variables inside the form blocks (e.g.
    simply ``label`` or ``id``).

Takeaways
---------

The key lesson is this: **each form is a big tree**. The top level ``Form`` has
children, each which is also a ``Form`` object (or a ``FormView`` object
when you're in Twig). If you want to access information about a field (is
it required? what are its errors?), you need to first get access to the *child*
form and go from there.
