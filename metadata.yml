            Sometimes, learning something technical is just plain hard. Information
            is scattered, opinions vary, and best-practices are buried. Nothing tells
            the whole, realistic story in a real world application. We work together
            on open source libraries, but not on tutorials.

            So now, we're excited to enter our next phase, where it's all
            about collaboration and working together!

        title: What the Rest?
        published: 2013-09-04
        preview: |
            REST is as deep as the rabbit hole, with varied approaches and undefined
            best-practices. Should I use custom hypermedia types or something
            like HAL or JSON-LD? Should I implement OPTIONS? What role
            should the API documentation play and what information should be described
            inside the API itself? In this post, I'm asking for help.

            questions remain before we release our REST tutorial.

            the Live Components package: the Stimulus controller, Component objects,
            how re-rendering happens & the internal plugins system. Yes, this one
            gets TECHY.

        published: 2024-02-26
        preview: |
            When you redirect from a `LiveAction`, LiveComponents, naturally,
            will perform a full page redirect (or redirect via `Turbo` if it's
            available. But what if you want to navigate a Turbo frame? The answer lies
            in some clever use of Turbo Streams.

            Now that you've created a Symfony reproducer, let's use it to fix a
            bug in Symfony or verify a fix proposed by someone else. We'll fork
            the Symfony repository, link our reproducer to it, and make the
            necessary changes.
