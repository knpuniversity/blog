            Sometimes, learning something technical is just plain hard. Information
            is scattered, opinions vary, and best-practices are buried. Nothing tells
            the whole, realistic story in a real world application. We work together
            on open source libraries, but not on tutorials.
            
            So now, we're excited to enter our next phase, where it's all
            about collaboration and working together!

        title: What the Rest?

            REST is as deep as the rabbit hole, with varied approaches and undefined
            best-practices. Should I use custom hypermedia types or something
            like HAL or JSON-LD? Should I implement OPTIONS? What role
            should the API documentation play and what information should be described
            inside the API itself? In this post, I'm asking for help.

            We're releasing the content of our screencasts and we want to get the
            license right. In this post, we give a little background and ask for
            your thoughts.
